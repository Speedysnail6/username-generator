{"name":"Username Generator","tagline":"Easily generate random usernames","body":"Username Generator\r\n==================\r\nUsername Generator is a simple PHP file that randomly generates a username. It can be easily accessed by other files as seen in the demo folder. If you point your browser to `generate.php`, it will generate a username. All the adjectives, nouns, and numbers can be added/removed one-per-line in text files. Sometimes, a username does not contain an adjective, noun, and/or number. This is not a glitch. Special parameters can be sent to `generate.php` via the URL or `$_GET`.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial Parameters\r\n------------------\r\nIf data is sent to `generate.php` through the URL for example `generate.php?prefix=xx_` or by sending it directly through a form with the method `$_GET`. The current parameters are:\r\n\r\n> **prefix** - what's before the username ex (the_awesome_)\r\n\r\n> **suffix** - what's after the username ex (_is_me)\r\n\r\n> **gm** - (generation method) how the username is generated ex (1)\r\n\r\n>*- Generation Method 1: Adjective, Noun Number*\r\n\r\n>*- Generation Method 2: Adjective, Noun*\r\n\r\n>**imporantnouns** - This can currently only be one noun.
