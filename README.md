username-generator
==================

Username Generator is a simple PHP script that randomly generates a username.

The list of nouns, adjectives, and numbers are all in separate text files (one per line) so you can easily edit them.

There is a demo bootstrap page that uses the script to generate the username.

Also, you can configure options for generating the username from both the demo page, and the script itself via the URL. (generate.php?suffix=hello).
